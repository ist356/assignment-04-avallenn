## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I felt very confident defining the functions, the only thing I was confused about was what a numpy_type is in the concept of the get_columns_type function, but after looking at the solutions for that function I learned that I was attempting to get the data type of that column, which can be done through the .dtype function. For the unibrow code I struggled a little more. I had a hard to visualizing what was expected for the output, so I ran the code in the solutions folder, and after doing that I created a better understanding. I was able to practice using the file uploader in streamlit again, which was good practice and was able to refer to examples in class on how to select certain columns in the dataframe (st.multiselect). When I was moving forward to getting filtered data and values, copoilt suggested using st.checkbox, so I did and looked it up to understand more about it. I now know that when I check that box, it almost counts as "true" for the if statement and excutes all the code under that condition such as the select boxes.
